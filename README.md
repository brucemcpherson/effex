Ephemeral exchange master repository

This is a cross platform cache, accessed by a simple REST API. No authentication is required, but registration (free) is required to create an account and access keys.

The data in the store is intended to be short lived, and access keys (which themselves expire after a given period of time) are required to access a given item. 

There is a tutorial app which will take you through how it works, provide examples of all possible operations, and allow you to manage your accounts and examine your store usage. 

This is in developer preview, so the final URLs are likely to change, but for now, the tutorial is here
